                        <h3>#1 MY TITHE</h3>
                        <p>God has established in scripture that we as believers should regularly give a proportionate gift of our income to support the work of the ministry, through the local church (Pr. 3:9; Acts 2; 2 Cor.8-9). God entrusts different amounts to each of us. We believe our tithe (or proportionate giving) is based on what God has entrusted to us individually. The tithe was first established as 10% in the Old Testament, but now under grace, we are not limited to any set percentageâ€¦ we can freely give as God has given to us.</p>

                        <hr />
                        <h3>#2 MY MISSION GIVING</h3>
                        <p>The Apostle Paul commended believers for additionally giving toward his missionary work (2 Cor. 8-9). They did so because of their extreme joy and generosity, even in the midst of their severe poverty. Likewise, we too are called to give proportionately and sacrificially. Sacrificial giving goes even further than our initial proportionate giving required by God, and offers an additional level of grace giving in light of the grace God has extended to us</p>

                        <hr />
